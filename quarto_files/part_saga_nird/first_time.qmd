# Setting up your account for working on saga

There are a few settings we need to change to ensure that we all get a good
working experience on saga.

The instructions are to be found in this file:

```/cluster/projects/nn9305k/samplefiles/new_user.txt```

`ssh` into saga, and go to the samplefiles directory. Use `less` to open 
the `new_user.txt` file. In order to do what is described in there, it 
is simplest to open a second terminal and copy-paste the commands into
the other terminal. The commands in question will primarily give you a
terminal setup that adjust file permissions so that the core team can see
your files. In addition, you are given access to the `conda` system which
we use to give access to software, as well as the software we have available
on the project area. 

Please note, log out of both (or all if you have more) terminals right 
after having doe these changes.
