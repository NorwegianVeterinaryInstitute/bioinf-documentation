# How to log in to Saga

Once you have your username and password, you need to log into Saga. To do that,
you need to access something that is called a terminal. A terminal is a window
into which you can type commands. There are three main ways to get to a terminal
window:

* Use the program putty (not recommended)
* Use the program called `git bash` (recommended)
* Use the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux)(recommended for advanced users

If you want to use putty

* Use the [self-service portal for software](http://software.vetinst.no/)
* Search for `putty` in the box, and click on the box. `putty` will now be installed
* When PuTTY starts, type ```saga.sigma2.no``` in the textbox where it says "Host Name or IP address". 

If you use `git bash`

* Go to [this website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and press `Download for Windows`
* Click on `Click here to download` to get the latest version. It will now be downloaded.
* Find the exe file that has been downloaded, and click on it. Click `Next` on all except for
    * select `nano` as the default editor
* Open git bash by typing `git bash` in the search bar - you will now have a terminal available
* Type in the following command on the command line that appears:
  ```ssh saga.sigma2.no```

If you want to use the Windows Subsystem for Linux
* Have IT install it for you
* Ask IT to also install the [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701)
* Click on the Windows Terminal Icon ![Screenshot 2021-08-23 140630](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77984068/130444354-13bb89ea-850d-4edb-83f1-f01a818a1e9e.png)
